# Building and Unit Testing an Express Application

## Preamble

In this tutorial, we're going to build and test an Express application from the ground up â€” using a number of different testing strategies. The goal of the this tutorial is to get super deep into a very small set of things so that you understand how they work.

You can find the original version of this tutorial at [Pizza Express](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/pizza-express). Check out that tutorial to see a straight forward implementation and some different technologies being implemented. It's always good to see a lot of different ways to create a thing.

This is the _extreme_ version... meaning that we will have a few different branches and many different implementations. Things might get a little weird.

## Lessons & Branches

* [Master](https://github.com/rrgayhart/extreme-pizza-express) - has a base level implementation and instructions for how to start the repo from scratch (if you so choose).
* [Server Testing]() - unit tests an initial implementation of the server.
